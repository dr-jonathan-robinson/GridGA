GridGA
======

Genetic algorithm designed to wrap an existing executable or script, and run on an HTCondor (previously named Condor) compute cluster. HTCondor can be downloaded from http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor.

## Requirements
To build from source, you'll need the boost libraries (http://www.boost.org). ZeroMQ libraries are included in the libs dir for Windows. For Linux you'll need to ensure ZeroMQ is installed.
